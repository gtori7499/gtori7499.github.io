# Gabriele Tori

Ph.D. Student in Economics at Emory University

Iâ€™m originally from Italy, where I earned a B.Sc. in Management and an M.Sc. in Economics and Social Sciences at Bocconi University (including an exchange year at the University of Amsterdam). I then spent two years as a research assistant studying historical finance and capital mobility. My current research lies in macroeconomics, with a particular focus on monetary policy and central bank communication.
